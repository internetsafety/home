<b>Welcome!</b>
<p>For my demonstration project I made a website to help people navigate the web easily. The first thing you should do on the website is test your browser's security. Most likely if you have either Chrome 3.0.195 or higher, or Firefox Quantum your browser will be fine. Next you should go onto the main part of the site, learning how to safely download a file. The way it works is there are a series of many levels based off of real life scenarios were you have to find the correct download button. As you make your way through the levels they get progressively harder. If you click the wrong download button it will tell you what you did wrong lets you try again. While this may seem easy for tech savvy people many people still struggle with these types of tricks and it needs to be stopped.</p>
