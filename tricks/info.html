<p>There are many ways to recognize a fake download button from a real one but the most common is look above the button and if there is tiny text that says Add: then that means it's fake. </p>
<button onclick="level1()">Level 1</button>
<button onclick="level2()">Level 2</button>
<button onclick="level3()">Level 3</button>
<script>
function level1() {
  window.location = "https://internetsafety.github.io/home/tricks/1";
}
function level2() {
  window.location = "https://internetsafety.github.io/home/tricks/2";
}
function level3() {
  window.location = "https://internetsafety.github.io/home/tricks/3";
}
</script>
